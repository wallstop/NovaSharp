# Real-World Lua Script Corpus (Planned)

> Placeholder: populate once permissively licensed Lua scripts are curated for automated testing.

## Goals
- Track source repositories/URLs, commit hashes, and licenses for every third-party script included in the regression suite.
- Describe how the scripts integrate with NovaSharp tests (TAP harness, NUnit wrappers, etc.).
- Capture update cadence and attribution requirements.

## TODO
- [ ] Curate candidate Unity-focused Lua scripts (permissive licenses only).
- [ ] Store scripts under `tests/fixtures/RealWorld` (or similar) with accompanying `LICENSE` files.
- [ ] Update this document with provenance metadata and integration notes.
